Here’s a simple implementation of a console-based Uno game in Python. It supports 2+ players, basic Uno rules (Skip, Reverse, Draw Two, Wild, Wild Draw Four), and turn management. This is a minimal, educational version and can be extended with more features.

How to run:
Save as uno.py.
Run: python uno.py
Follow console instructions!
